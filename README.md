<h1 align="center" id="title">Event-Driven-Order-Lifecycle-Management-System</h1>

<p id="description">This project is a Java-based event-driven microservices system built using Spring Boot and Apache Kafka managing the full lifecycle of an order ‚Äî from placement to user notification. It emphasizes clean architecture SOLID principles and scalable system design.</p>

Implemented Workflow
**1. Order Service**
Accepts incoming order requests
Persists order data
Publishes order-created event
 
**2. Fraud Service**
Consumes order-created event
Performs fraud validation
Publishes order-validated event
 
**3. Payment Service**
Consumes order-validated event
Adds payment info and processes payment
Publishes payment-processed event
 
**4. Shipment Service**
Consumes payment-processed event
Dispatches and delivers shipment
Publishes shipment-dispatched and shipment-delivered events

**5. Order Completion**
Consumes shipment-delivered event
Updates order status to COMPLETED
Publishes order-completed event
 
**6. Notification Service**
Consumes order-completed event
Sends user notification

**How to Run**
Ensure Kafka and Zookeeper are running (Docker or local).
Start each Spring Boot service individually.
Use Swagger or a Postman to place an order and trace the lifecycle through Kafka events.

**Key Highlights**
Asynchronous event handling using Kafka topics.
Clear domain ownership and service boundaries.
Robust error handling for serialization and deserialization failures.
Follows clean architecture and system design principles.
